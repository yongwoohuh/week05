# Sum Array of Numbers

This is an iOS project that contains a starting point for you to implement a recursive algorithm.

> Open the `main.swift` file. You will see the following function:

```swift
func sumItems(_ array: [Any]) -> Int {
  // Sum all numbers in the array
  return -1
}
```

> Push `Command + U` on your keyboard to run the unit tests. 

You will see the iPhone simulator appear and you should that the tests are failing.
